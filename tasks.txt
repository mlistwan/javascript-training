1. Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.
2. Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.
